## Description

For this project, I used Javascript to create generate a random password. I created the HTML document first the. Then I created a Javascript document and linked it to the HTML one.  I used methods getElementById and querySelector to return elements with specified values needed to create funtions.  I used addEventListener function with if statements to gather the user input. Then I did a for loop in the password function to generate the random password. I used the MathRandom function to return a random number and Math.floor to ensure the number return a whole number.

## Instillaton

Visual Studio Code was used as the source-code editor.  Google FU was utilized a lot in this application.
